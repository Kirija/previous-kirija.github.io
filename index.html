Since Winter 2019, I am a _Professeur_ of Software Engineering at [_Université du Québec à Montréal_](https://uqam.ca/) (UQAM), member of the [_Département d'Informatique_](https://info.uqam.ca/). As a researcher, I focus my effort on software composition and scalability of software design. As a teacher, I give lectures related to software engineering and software architecture.
