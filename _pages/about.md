Since Winter 2020, I am a _Professeur_ of Computing Science at [_Université du Québec à Montréal_](https://uqam.ca/) (UQAM), member of the [_Département d'Informatique_](https://info.uqam.ca/) and of the [_LATECE_](https://latece.uqam.ca). I'm interested in security, privacy and applied cryptography.

An important part of my research is concerned with exploiting the latest developments of homomorphic encryption in order to provide better _Privacy Enhancing Technologies_. For example, we developped the [_NFLLib_](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib) toolkit and [_XPIR_ Private Information Retrieval](https://github.com/XPIR-team/XPIR) on top of it.
